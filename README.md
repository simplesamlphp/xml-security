This library implements XML signatures and encryption. It provides an extensible
interface that allows you to use your own signature and encryption
implementations, and deals with everything else to sign, verify, encrypt and
decrypt your XML objects. It is built on top of the [xml-common](https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-common)
library, which provides you with a standard API to create PHP objects from their
XML representation, as well as producing XML from your objects. The aim of the
library is to provide a secure, yet flexible implementation of the xmldsig and
xmlenc standards in PHP.

The library provides two main ways to use it, one API for signed XML documents,
and another for encrypted ones. Additionally, the lower level APIs are
available to implement those operations yourself if needed, although we highly
recommend using the main interfaces.

## Signature API

The XML signature API consists mainly of two interfaces:

- `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignableElementInterface`
- `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignedElementInterface`

In general, both should be used together. The former signals that an object can
be signed (and as such mandates the implementation of a `sign()` method in the
object), while the latter indicates that an object is already signed and allows
the verification of its signature by means of `verify()` method.

Since the signature API is provided via PHP interfaces, your objects need to
implement those interfaces. For your convenience, each interface is accompanied
by two traits with the actual implementation for the PHP interfaces:

- `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignableElementTrait`
- `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignedElementTrait`

Both declare an abstract `getId()` method that you will have to implement, since
only you know what attribute is declared in your XML objects to act
as an `xml:id`.

The two interfaces mentioned extend from a third one,
`SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\CanonicalizableElementInterface`. This interface
ensures that your XML objects can be properly canonicalized, so that if they
were created from an actual XML document, it will be possible to restore that
original XML document from your object. Again, a
`SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\CanonicalizableElementTrait` is provided for your
convenience. This trait implements the canonicalization for you, and ensures
that your object can be serialized and later unserialized, but in exchange
requires you to implement a `getOriginalXML()` method. This means you will
have to keep the original XML that created your object, if any.

In general, your code should implement both main interfaces and use the traits.
The bare minimum you will need to do to add XML signature capabilities to your
objects will look like the following:

```php
namespace MyNamespace;

use DOMElement;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignableElementInterface;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignableElementTrait;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignedElementInterface;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignedElementTrait;

class MyObject implements SignableElementInterface, SignedElementInterface
{
    use SignableElementTrait;
    use SignedElementTrait;
    
    ...
    
    public function getId(): ?string
    {
        // return the ID of your object
    }
    
    
    protected function getOriginalXML(): DOMElement
    {
        // return the original XML, if any, or the XML generated by your object
    }
}
```

However, we strongly recommend your XML objects to build on top of the API
provided by [xml-common](https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-common). That way,
you should probably have an abstract class to declare your namespace and
namespace prefix:

```php
namespace MyNamespace;

use SimpleSAML\XML\AbstractElement;

abstract class AbstractMyNSElement extends AbstractElement
{
    public const NS = 'my:namespace';
    
    public const NS_PREFIX = 'prefix';
}
```

Then your object can extend from that:

```php
namespace MyNamespace;

use DOMElement;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignableElementInterface;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignableElementTrait;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignedElementInterface;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\SignedElementTrait;

class MyObject extends AbstractMyNSElement 
    implements SignableElementInterface, SignedElementInterface
{
    use SignableElementTrait;
    use SignedElementTrait;
    
    ...
    
    public function getId(): ?string
    {
        // return the ID of your object
    }
    
    
    protected function getOriginalXML(): DOMElement
    {
        // return the original XML, if any, or the XML generated by your object
    }
    
    
    public static function fromXML(DOMElement $xml): object
    {
        // build an instance of your object based on an XML document
        // representing it
    }
    
    
    public function toXML(DOMElement $parent = null): DOMElement
    {
        // build an XML representation of your object
    }
}
```

Have a look at the `CustomSignable` class provided with the tests in this
repository to get an idea of how a working implementation could look like.

When dealing with XML signatures, you typically need to provide two things:
the signature algorithm you want to use and a key. Depending on the
algorithm, one type of key or another would be suitable.
For that reason, this library introduces the concept of a
`SignatureAlgorithm`, which is a given instance of an algorithm with a key
associated. `SignatureAlgorithm`s can be used then as _signers_
(when signing an object) and _verifiers_ (when used to verify a signature).
This interface, together with the ones provided for key material and signature
backends, will allow you to sign and verify signatures without much effort.

### Signing

If you want to sign an object representing an XML document, the
`SignableElementTrait` provides you with a `doSign()` method that you can use
for your convenience. This method takes the XML document you want to sign, and
returns another document result of applying all signature transforms to the
input. The _signer_ implementation to use will be obtained from the `$signer`
property of the trait, which in turn will be set by the `sign()` method it
provides as well. After the XML is signed successfully, `doSign()` will not only
return the signed version of it, but also populate the `$signature` property
with a `Signature` object.

If you are using the API provided by [xml-common], you would typically
implement support for signing your objects like this:

[xml-common]: https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-common

```php
    public function toXML(DOMElement $parent = null): DOMElement
    {
        if ($this->signer !== null) {
            $signedXML = $this->doSign($this->getMyXML());
            $signedXML->insertBefore($this->signature->toXML($signedXML), $signedXML->firstChild);
            return $signedXML;
        }

        return $this->getMyXML();
    }
```

Note that you will need to implement a mechanism to obtain the actual
`DOMElement` to sign. It could be a method itself, as depicted in this example,
or it could be stored in a class property.

At this point, your object is ready to be signed. You just need to create
a _signer_, pass it to `sign()`, and create the XML representation (which
will do the actual signing) by calling `toXML()`:

```php
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Constants as C;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Alg\Signature\SignatureAlgorithmFactory;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Key\PrivateKey;

$key = PrivateKey::fromFile('/path/to/key.pem');
$signer = (new SignatureAlgorithmFactory())->getAlgorithm(
    C::SIG_RSA_SHA256,
    $key
);
$myObject->sign($signer);
$signedXML = $myObject->toXML();
```

That's it, you have signed your first object!

Now, you can customize your signatures as much as you want. For example, you can
add the X509 certificate corresponding your private key to it, and specify the
canonicalization algorithm to use:

```php
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Constants as C;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\ds\KeyInfo;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\ds\X509Certificate;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\ds\X509Data

...

$keyInfo = new KeyInfo(
    [
        new X509Data(
            [
                new X509Certificate($base64EncodedCertificateData)
            ]
        )
    ]
);

$customSignable->sign(
    $signer,
    C::C14N_EXCLUSIVE_WITHOUT_COMMENTS,
    $keyInfo
);

...
```

If you are planning on **embedding your signed object inside a larger
XML document**, make sure to **give it an unique identifier**. Your
object will need to generate an XML with an _ID_ attribute (of type `xml:id`)
holding the identifier of the element, and the `getId()` method **must** return
that very same identifier.

### Verifying

In order to verify signed objects, the `SignedElementInterface` provides you
with the following methods:

- `getId()`: retrieves the unique identifier of the object.
- `getSignature()`: retrieves the signature of the object as a
  `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\ds\Signature` object.
- `getValidatingKey()`: retrieves the key the signature has been verified with.
- `isSigned()`: tells whether the object is in fact signed or not.
- `verify()`: verifies the signature of the object.

If your class has implemented support for signing its objects, and you are
implementing the `SignedElementInterface` and using the `SignedElementTrait`,
support for verifying the signatures comes out of the box.

The process for verifying a signature is similar to the one of creating one.
You will need to instantiate a signature verifier with some key material and a
signature algorithm, and use it to verify the signature itself:

```php
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Alg\Signature\SignatureAlgorithmFactory;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Key\PublicKey;

$verifier = (new SignatureAlgorithmFactory())->getAlgorithm(
    $myObject->getSignature()->getSignedInfo()->getSignatureMethod()->getAlgorithm(),
    PublicKey::fromFile('/path/to/public-key.pem')
);
$verified = $myObject->verify($verifier);
```

> :warning: WARNING
>
> Note the `$verified` variable returned by `verify()`. The method does not
return a `boolean` value to tell you if the signature was verified or not.
Instead, if it fails to verify, an exception will be thrown. Its return
value then is an object of the same class of your original object
(`$myObject`), only that it is built based on the XML document whose
signature has been verified. **It is very important that you use only objects
built based on a verified signature**. Otherwise, any possible issue during
the signature process could leave you with a tampered object whose signature
doesn't really verify.

There is one alternative way to verify signatures. If the signature itself
contains the key we can use to verify it (namely, an X509 certificate), then
we can call `verify()` without passing a verifier to it, and check that the
key used to verify the signature matches the one we expect:

```php
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\ds\X509Certificate;

$trustedCertificate = new X509Certificate($pemEncodedCertificate);
$verified = $myObject->verify();

if ($verified->getValidatingKey() === $trustedCertificate) {
    // signature verified with a trusted certificate
}
```

This last usage pattern is more convenient since you don't have to create a
_verifier_, although it forces you to **remember that you need to check the
key used to verify the signature**.

## Encryption API

The XML encryption API is similar to its signature counterpart, and also
consists of two main interfaces:

- `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\EncryptableElementInterface`
- `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\EncryptedElementInterface`

Just like in the signature API, the former signals that an object can be
encrypted (and as such requires the implementation of an `encrypt()` method),
while the latter means an object is already encrypted (and therefore requires
a `decrypt()` method to be implemented). There is a substantial difference with
the signature API though: you need to implement two different classes, one for
your objects themselves, and another for your encrypted objects. The former
will then implement `EncryptableElementInterface`, while the latter will be
the one implementing `EncryptedElementInterface`.

Again, the library provides a couple of traits for your convenience, in order
to minimise the amount of code you have to write. Those traits are:

- `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\EncryptableElementTrait`
- `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\EncryptedElementTrait`

Both traits are somewhat asymmetrical, in the sense that while
`EncryptableElementTrait` does implement the `encrypt()` method, the
`EncryptedElementTrait` does not implement its `decrypt()` counterpart.
This is because the way objects are encrypted may vary a lot, and the
application itself will be the only one that knows exactly how that should
be done. A basic default implementation that should cover most use cases
is provided, though.

As with digital signatures, we provide classes that demonstrate the encryption
functionality. You may have a look at the `CustomSignable` class provided with
the tests in order to see how encryption can be added to your objects, and the
`EncryptedCustom` class will then demonstrate how to deal with objects that
are already encrypted.

### Decrypting objects

In XML encryption, when you have an encrypted object, you typically wrap that
inside a specific element that signals that the object represents an encrypted
version of another object. You may have your own elements and logic in that
encrypted object, but the absolute minimum would be an `xenc:EncryptedData`
element inside. This means you will have to create classes for your encrypted
objects, and they will have to implement the `EncryptedElementInterface`.

The simplest approach is then to take advantage of `EncryptedElementTrait` and
again, we recommend taking advantage of the XML object framework provided by
`simplesamlphp/xml-common`. The only thing you will then have to implement is
the `decrypt()` method, and a couple of getters required by the trait:

```php

use SimpleSAML\XML\AbstractElement;
use SimpleSAML\XML\ElementInterface;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Alg\Encryption\EncryptionAlgorithmInterface;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Backend\EncryptionBackend;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\EncryptedElementInterface;

class MyEncryptedObject extends AbstractElement
  implements EncryptedElementInterface
{
    use EncryptedElementTrait;
    
    
    public function getBlacklistedAlgorithms(): ?array
    {
        // return an array with the algorithms you don't want to allow to be used
    }
    
    
    public function getEncryptionBackend(): ?EncryptionBackend
    {
        // return the encryption backend you want to use,
        // or null if you are fine with the default
    }
    
    
    public function decrypt(EncryptionAlgorithmInterface $decryptor): MyObject 
    {
        // implement the actual decryption here with help from the library
    }
}
```

Note that the value returned by `decrypt()` here is your own `MyObject` class.
This means `MyObject` needs to extend `SimpleSAML\XML\ElementInterface`, but
it is also one of the reasons why the implementation of `decrypt()` is left to
the application.

Now, the aim of this library is of course to make your life easier so that you
don't actually have to implement decryption yourself. The following
implementation of `decrypt()` will be suitable for most use cases:

```php
    public function decrypt(EncryptionAlgorithmInterface $decryptor): MyObject
    {
        return MyObject::fromXML(
            \SimpleSAML\XML\DOMDocumentFactory::fromString(
                $this->decryptData($decryptor)
            )->documentElement
        );
    }
```

So what did just happen here? `MyObject` is supposed to implement
`ElementInterface`, right? That means it must implement a `fromXML()` static
method that creates a new instance of the class based on what's passed to it as
a `DOMElement` object. The `DOMElement` itself was created with help from the
`DOMDocumentFactory` class, which in turn took the `string` result of calling
the `decryptData()` method provided by the trait. And that's it, that might be
all you need to decrypt your encrypted objects!

Bear in mind though that this is the most basic use case. Your encrypted
objects will need to look like this:

```xml
<MyEncryptedObject>
  <xenc:EncryptedData xmlns:xenc="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#">
    <xenc:EncryptionMethod Algorithm="..."/>
    <xenc:CipherData>
      <xenc:CipherValue>...</xenc:CipherValue>
    </xenc:CipherData>
  </xenc:EncryptedData>
</MyEncryptedObject>
```

If you need any more elements inside, attributes in the root element or anything
else, you will have to adjust the implementation for that. In that case, you may
need a different constructor for your encrypted objects than the one provided by
the trait. You can define your own constructor while taking advantage of the one
in the trait by renaming the latter:

```php

use SimpleSAML\XML\AbstractElement;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\EncryptedElementInterface;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\xenc\EncryptedData;

class MyEncryptedObject extends AbstractElement
  implements EncryptedElementInterface
{
    use EncryptedElementTrait {
        __construct as constructor;
    }
    
    
    public function __construct(EncryptedData $encryptedData, ...)
    {
        $this->constructor($encryptedData);
        
        ...
    }
}
```

Similarly, if your encryption scheme does not fit with any of the two supported
by default, you will also need to implement it yourself. The two encryption
schemes supported are:

- **Shared key encryption**: both parties share a secret key and use it to
  encrypt and decrypt the objects, respectively. This means the
  `<xenc:EncryptionMethod>` element will have a block  cipher specified in
  the `Algorithm` attribute. The `$decryptor` object passed to the `decrypt()`
  method will then be created for that block cipher in particular, and the key
  used will be a  `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Key\SymmetricKey` object with the
  shared secret as the key material.
- **Asymmetric encryption**: in this case, public key cryptography is used to
  encrypt the objects. However, public key cryptography is extremely costly in
  computational terms, so in a similar fashion to digital signatures, what we do
  is to generate a random secret or _session key_, which will be used to encrypt
  the object itself with a block cipher, and in turn we will encrypt that key
  with the recipient's public key.

  In this case, the `$decryptor` will implement a _key transport_ algorithm
  (which in turn is just an asymetric encryption algorithm like RSA), and the
  key attached to it will be a `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Key\PrivateKey` object
  with the recipient's private key.

  When using asymmetric encryption, your encrypted XML objects will look
  similar to this:

  ```xml
  <MyEncryptedObject>
    <xenc:EncryptedData xmlns:xenc="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#">
      <xenc:EncryptionMethod Algorithm="BLOCK CIPHER ALGORITHM IDENTIFIER"/>
      <dsig:KeyInfo xmlns:dsig="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#">
        <xenc:EncryptedKey>
          <xenc:EncryptionMethod Algorithm="KEY TRANSPORT ALGORITHM IDENTIFIER"/>
          <xenc:CipherData>
            <xenc:CipherValue>...</xenc:CipherValue>
          </xenc:CipherData>
        </xenc:EncryptedKey>
      </dsig:KeyInfo>
      <xenc:CipherData>
        <xenc:CipherValue>...</xenc:CipherValue>
      </xenc:CipherData>
    </xenc:EncryptedData>
  </MyEncryptedObject> 
  ```
  
  The innermost `<xenc:CipherValue>` will contain the encrypted session key,
  while the outermost will contain the encrypted object itself.

The `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\EncryptedElementTrait::decryptData()` method is
capable of handling both encryption schemes. If your application uses any of
those, you can just use the method by passing the appropriate _decryptor_ as
explained earlier. If you are using _shared key encryption_, you can then just
do the following:

```php
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Alg\Encryption\EncryptionAlgorithmFactory;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Key\SymmetricKey;

$decryptor = (new EncryptionAlgorithmFactory())->getAlgorithm(
    $myEncryptedObject->getEncryptedData()->getEncryptionMethod()->getAlgorithm(),
    new SymmetricKey('MY SHARED SECRET')
);
$myObject = $myEncryptedObject->decrypt($decryptor);
```

> :warning: WARNING
>
> Always make sure that the algorithm specified in the `<xenc:EncryptionMethod>`
> element is a block cipher algorithm. Only in that case the library will
> attempt to decrypt using the shared secret encryption scheme. The
> `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Constants::$BLOCK_CIPHER_ALGORITHMS` associative
> array contains as keys all the identifiers of block ciphers supported by this
> library.

Alternatively, if your application uses asymmetric encryption, you will have to
use an appropriate decryptor instantiated with your private key in order to
decrypt your objects:

```php
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Alg\KeyTransport\KeyTransportAlgorithmFactory;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Key\PrivateKey;

$decryptor = (new KeyTransportAlgorithmFactory())->getAlgorithm(
    $myEncryptedObject->getEncryptedKey()->getEncryptionMethod()->getAlgorithm(),
    PrivateKey::fromFile('/path/to/private-key.pem')
);
$myObject = $myEncryptedObject->decrypt($decryptor);
```

One last note: you may have noticed the `getBlacklistedAlgorithms()` and
`getEncryptionBackend()` methods that you are required to implement when using
`EncryptedElementTrait`. These methods are needed because of asymmetric
encryption support. Since the library will have to create a block cipher
decryptor with the session key, the user does not control that decryptor and
therefore won't be able to specify directly neither the algorithms to forbid
nor the encryption backend to use. Hence the need of these two methods, which
will allow the trait to modify any of those parameters for the decryptor it
will build. If you just want to use the default values, just implement them to
return `null`. However, if you want to customise the algorithms you accept
and/or the backend to use, then you will have to return the desired values in
those methods.

### Encrypting objects

If you want to support decrypting objects, it is likely that you also want to
encrypt them in the first place. Doing so is as simple as implementing the
`SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\EncryptableElementInterface`:

```php
use SimpleSAML\XML\AbstractElement;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\EncryptableElementInterface;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\EncryptableElementTrait;

class MyObject extends AbstractElement
  implements EncryptableElementInterface
{
    use EncryptableElementTrait;


    public function getBlacklistedAlgorithms(): ?array
    {
        // return an array with the algorithms you don't want to allow to be used
    }
    
    
    public function getEncryptionBackend(): ?EncryptionBackend
    {
        // return the encryption backend you want to use,
        // or null if you are fine with the default
    }
}
```

That's it. Easy, isn't it? In this case, the `encrypt()` method is provided
directly by `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\EncryptableElementTrait`, since its
return value will always be a `SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\XML\xenc\EncryptedData`
object. Again, you have to implement a couple of abstract methods required by
the trait in order to tell it what algorithms are supported and what backend
it should use in case of asymmetric encryption.

Now, we just need to actually encrypt our objects. If our application uses
shared key encryption, we just need to create an appropriate encryptor with
a symmetric key:

```php
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Constants as C;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Alg\Encryption\EncryptionAlgorithmFactory;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Key\SymmetricKey;

$encryptor = (new EncryptionAlgorithmFactory())->getAlgorithm(
    C::BLOCK_ENC_...,
    new SymmetricKey('MY SHARED SECRET')
);
$myEncryptedObject = $myObject->encrypt($encryptor)
```

If, on the contrary, we want to use an asymmetric encryption scheme, our
encryptor will need to implement a _key transport_ algorithm, and use a
public key:

```php
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Constants as C;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Alg\KeyTransport\KeyTransportAlgorithmFactory;
use SimpleSAML\XMLSecurity\Key\PublicKey;

$encryptor = (new KeyTransportAlgorithmFactory())->getAlgorithm(
    C::KEY_TRANSPORT_...,
    PublicKey::fromFile('/path/to/public-key.pem')
);
$myEncryptedObject = $myObject->encrypt($encryptor);
```

That will cover most needs. In general, **asymmetric encryption** will be
preferred for most applications, as secret management is a difficult problem to
tackle. If you need to implement a different encryption scheme than the two
supported here, you will have to implement the `encrypt()` method yourself.

## Extending the library

Not available yet.

## Keys for testing purposes

All encrypted keys use '1234' as passphrase.

The following keys are available:

- signed      - A CA-signed certificate
- other       - Another CA-signed certificate
- selfsigned  - A self-signed certificate
- broken      - A file with a broken PEM-structure
                (all spaces are removed from the headers)
- corrupted   - This looks like a proper certificate
                (every first & last character of every line has been swapped)
- expired     - This CA-signed certificate expires the moment it is generated
